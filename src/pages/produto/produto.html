            The most popular industrial group ever, and largely
            responsible for bringing the music to a mass audience.
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
             random text. It has roots in a piece of classical 
             Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 
             years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
             at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up 
             one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
              from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
              the cites of the word in classical literature, 
              discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum 
              comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de 
              Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of 
              Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. 
              This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, 
              very popular during the Renaissance. The first 
              line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", 
              comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
